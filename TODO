Now:
- support enum fields with default value
- use a single class with enums for sum types, provide a getKind()
  returning the constructor; provide unsafe getters to get the
  associated value if any, and a setter for each case.

Later:
- use ArrayList instead of regular arrays
- support top-level lists
- Add support for lists of lists
- Add location information to exceptions (need own parser)
